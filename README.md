Udacity Deep Learning course work

This repository contains some of the course work I did for Udacity's deep learning course.The code is in form of .py files, and not python notebooks as the course expects. I found writing code as simple python files a bit more flexible for me, than using notebooks (I am also learning python, so this might change later).

Its been open sourced to get comments, suggestions for improvements and it might be useful for people interested in DL, and especially this particular course.
